# AlgebraicNLP
When Algera meets NLP, NLP can be used to solve algera problems, algera can be used to solve NLP problem at the same time.

# What can Algera bring to NLP?
Algera can be used to describe semi-stuctured relation. Structured data, such as image, time series, can be described easily. None structured data, such as natual language, can be processed by NLP. 
Semi-structured data is hard to describe and process.

## Syntax tree can be used to describe the semi-structured data.
Structured NLP ( Syntax Tree, RegEX, Symbolic Math)
Directional offered operation, unordered

## Parameters can make the syntax tree more general.
So that NLP can deal with all specific values with one template. At the same time, the training size is shrinked greatly. In other words, there are much less for the model to memorize.

## Prefix or postfix can turn the syntax tree into a sequence.
So that normal sequence based NLP models can be used.


# What can NLP bring to Algera?
## NLP can make Algera more experience based.
## NLP can be fast
Use NLP to solve Math.

# In short, Algera makes NLP more clever, from Arithmetic to Algera.

# An experiment is to solve a Symbolic Math prolem, Integral specifically.
I am working on it and hope I can finish it in 1 or 2 week.
